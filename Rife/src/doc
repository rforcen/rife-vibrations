the quantum sound shift (qss)

this technique combines healing rife tones with the halographic patterns of sanskrit bija mantra, 

the bija mantra set of sanskrit phonemes is decoded into it's main formant frequencies using accurate LPC algorithms to generate complex holographic resonant 
patterns, this is reverse engineering original rishi coding of sanskrit representation of the vibration of each chakra, 

each rife tone is them tuned to the bija mantra coding improving and expanding its healing properties,

listening with open mind you will hear a song, the quantum song of life
